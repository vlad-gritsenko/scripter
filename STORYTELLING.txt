      "common": "Do not put name of the text sections, for example Part 1, Hook, Main Part and so on, do not put timestamps in text. Script should contain only the story itself. Avoid symbols. Don't use tags: speak, break, emphasis and any other SSML tags. Don't capitalize entire words: instead of important, write important. Limit exclamations: no more than one exclamation mark in a row. Don't put the entire sentence in quotation marks: This is an error, not 'This is an error'. Abbreviations and special characters in words: Control Z instead of Ctrl plus Z. Fifty percent instead of fifty percent sign. First of February two thousand and twenty-three instead of zero one slash zero two slash two thousand and twenty-three. Example dot com slash page instead of example dot com slash page. Don't insert ellipses and em dashes in a row. Avoid non-standard characters and diacritics. Write short sentences. No more than eight hundred characters per block. Do not include anything that does not need to be pronounced."},
